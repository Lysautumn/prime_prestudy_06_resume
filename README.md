#Resume Re-Re-Challenge
This is the remake of my Prime resume for week 6 of prework.

In this challenge, I added a button that needs to be clicked in order to view the resume.

This project contains three files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

##index.html
This file contains the markup for the resume.

##style.css
This file is for the styling of the resume.

##script.js
This contains the code to make the button work.
